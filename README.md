Use threshold crossing to detect location of R-wave in the ECG waveform and then detects the time interval between each R-wave to calculate heart rate as a function of time

###ECG_samples.csv
This is the datafile pulled from https://physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM (From Apnea-ECG database, Record a01)

###.pdf files
